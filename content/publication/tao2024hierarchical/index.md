abstract: "Time series classification plays a fundamental role in a wide range of real-world applications. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong generalization and reasoning capacities, but directly applying them to time series classification remains non-trivial due to the representation gap between numerical sequences and linguistic semantics. In this paper, we propose HiTime, a hierarchical LLM-based framework for multimodal time series classification that bridges structured temporal representations with semantic reasoning in a generative paradigm. Specifically, we design a hierarchical sequence feature encoding module composed of a data-specific encoder and a task-specific encoder to extract complementary temporal features. To mitigate the embedding gap between time series representations and textual semantics, we further introduce a semantic space alignment module that jointly performs coarse-grained global modeling and fine-grained cross-modal correspondence. Building upon the above representations, we employ a parameter-efficient supervised fine-tuning strategy to activate the generative classification capability of the algined LLMs, thereby transforming conventional discriminative time series classification into a generative task. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines."
